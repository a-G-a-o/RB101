Question 1:

    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
    numbers.uniq

    puts numbers

This code would print out:
1
2
2
3

Since numbers.uniq isn't a mutating method and did not mutate the caller. 
When calling p numbers, it calls the original numbers array.


Question 2:
!, the bang suffix, could signify a mutating method OR a negating function. 
When placed at the end of a method, it depends on the method implementation.
? follows a predicate method and evaluates to boolean values true or false.

1. != "not equals", used in a comparison statement
2. ! before something turns object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent
3. ! after something turns method into a mutating method AND depends on method implementation
4. ? before something, ie: ? : ternary operator for if...else statement
5. ? after something turns the method into a boolean evaluation
6. !! before something - used to turn an object into their boolean equivalent
