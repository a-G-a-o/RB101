What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?

'greeting' on the last line is nil and doesnt print anything to the console. 
However since 'greeting' has been initalize within the if block, there is no error exception thrown.
=end

if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

greeting
